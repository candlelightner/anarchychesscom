# README
### Goal
The end goal of this project is to ???. But it should be a fun project to work on and playing on the server (once it gets officially released) should be entertaining as well.

### Running the project
As this project is currently in an early stage of development, it has only been run using the Visual Studio 2022 IDE. To run the project, open the solution file in Visual Studio and run the project. The project will be hosted on ```localhost:5001```. You will have to provide a SMTP server in the ```appsettings.json``` file. The ```appsettings.Development.json``` file is used for development purposes and is not required to run the project.
